# ascii-ifier
ASCII-ify your image!
---------------------
This program reads a .bmp file and generates an ASCII-art represenation in the command line.
Currently only supports .bmp files in 24 bit-per-pixel format but will support more in the future.

TODO:
1. Support more bpp formats.

FUTURE IDEAS:
1. Support formats other than just .bmp
